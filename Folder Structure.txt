All combinations and corresponding encodings are given in PubMed/_index.txt.
	[keyword A, keyword B]: A[#]/B[#]

Each folder in PubMed/A[#]/B[#]/ contains index.txt and download_links.txt
	index.txt contains a brief description for each article.
		<TIL> / title
		<ABS> / abstract
		<PMID> / PubMed ID
		<DOI> / Document ID
	download_links.txt contains the downloadable urls for each article title if they have doi's.
		[title]: [url]

Note:
	1. not every article has a doi, so these articles don't have a url attached.
	2. for each url, there is a chance that sci-hub does not have the corresponding article.
